# Surprise Housing Regression Assignment
> Problem Statement
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing company wants to use data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. The goal is to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties using a data set comprised of sale details of houses in Australia.

As a result, The company wants to understand which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house and how well those variables describe the price of a house.

## General Information
- Surprise Housing company wants to predict the price of a house by providing various features of a house.
- Problem Statement
	- understand which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
	- How well those variables describe the price of a house.
- Datasets used: 
  Surprise Housing Dataset, that contains the records of sales of houses made in Australia.
	
## Conclusions
- Linear Regression, Ridge and Lasso models are built and assessed to determine the most optimal model
- From the evaluation metrics of all the three, Lasso appears simpler and more optimized with better results on unknown data.
- By analyzing more the model parameters, its observed that the Housing customers are concerned about Neighborhood, sq.ft area of ground floor, 1st floor, 2nd floor etc.
- Size of the Garage also is an important factor.
- Build quality of basement, Foundation, exterior, Overall Quality of the house, House Style etc are important factors.


## Technologies Used
- Python - 3.11.5
- Pandas - 2.0.3
- matplotlib - 3.7.2
- seaborn - 0.12.2
