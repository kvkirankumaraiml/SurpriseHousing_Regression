# Surprise Housing Regression Assignment
> Problem Statement
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing company wants to use data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. The goal is to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties using a data set comprised of sale details of houses in Australia.

As a result, The company wants to understand which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house and how well those variables describe the price of a house.

## General Information
- Surprise Housing company wants to predict the price of a house by providing various features of a house.
- Problem Statement
	- understand which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
	- How well those variables describe the price of a house.
- Datasets used: 
  Surprise Housing Dataset, that contains the records of sales of houses made in Australia.
	
## Conclusions
- From the model parameters, it is understood that the Casual drives, Working Day (indicates business day), and the year (year by year increase) are contributing positive significantly towards the demand of the shared bikes
- The Linear Regression model perfectly fits for this objective, as the data target variable count of Rides is linear to the other independent variables like Weather condition, seasons, etc.
- It’s clearly evident that Spring has a lesser number of rides compared with the other three seasons
- And the “Fall” season has highest number of rides compared with the other three seasons
- And the number of rides are increased year by year across all the weather conditions

## Technologies Used
- Python - 3.11.5
- Pandas - 2.0.3
- matplotlib - 3.7.2
- seaborn - 0.12.2
